        <h3>Death Note</h3>
        <img src="images/ryuk.jpg" alt="Shinigami Ryuk">
        <p>Death Note is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by 
            Takeshi Obata. The story follows Light Yagami, a teen genius who discoveres a 
            mysterious notebook: the "Death Note", which belonged to the shinigami Ryuk, and grants
            the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone whose name is written in its pages.
            The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death Note to carry
            out a worldwide massacre of inidividuals whom he deems immoral and to create a crime-free 
            society, using the alias of a god-like vigilante named "Kira", and the subsequent efforts 
            of an elite Japanese police task force, led by enigmatic detective L, to apprehend him. 
            <br><br>A 37-episode anime television series adaptation, produced by Madhouse and directed 
            by Tetsuro Araki, was broadcasted on Nippon Television from October 2006 to June 
            2007. A light novel based on the series, written by Nisio Isin, was also released in 
            2006. Aditionally, various video games have been published by Konami for the Nintendo DS.
            The series was adapted into three live action films released in Japan in June 2006, November 2006, 
            and February 2008, and a television drama in 2015. A miniseries titled Death Note: New Generation 
            and a fourth film adaptation was released exclusively on Netflix in August 2017 and a 
            sequel is reportedly in the works.
