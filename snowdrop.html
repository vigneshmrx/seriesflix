        <p><i>Snowdrop</i> takes place in 1987, a pivotal year in South Korean history that included the June 1987 
        Democracy Movement, a mass protest movement witht the purpose of forcing the dictatorship in South Korea to 
        hold fair elections, and the resulting December 1987 democratic elections, which led to the end of the 
        authoritarian Fifth Republic of Korea and the establishment of the democratic Sixth Republic of Korea.<br><br>
        <i>Snowdrop</i> is set in November and December 1987. Lim Soo-ho (Jung Hae-in) plays a graduate student who
        is found covered in blood by Eun Yeong-ro (Jisoo), a female university student and hides him from the government 
        in her dorm room. However, it is revealed that Soo-ho is not who he appears to be. Against the backdrop of 
        political upheaval, the pair's story unfolds and the two develop a romantic relationship.</p>
